# RPNTrafficControl

Small desktop app that launches OBS Studio with --startrecording arguments at user's set time (and stop/quit) automatically.

The app was made to automate (OBS) recording of RPN stations' daily audio broadcast for monitoring later.
It was developed on a Windows 11 beta OS and runs well on a Windows 10 PC. The app runs silently on the system tray.
